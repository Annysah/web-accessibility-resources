# What is Web Accessibility
**Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web, contributing to a more inclusive online experience.**

Web accessibility means designing websites that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities. This might include people with visual impairments, hearing loss, mobility limitations, or cognitive differences.

# Why is Web Accessibility Important

- **Wider audience reach**: Imagine the extra people you could connect with if your website was accessible! Accessible websites allow everyone to use your information and services, increasing your potential audience.
- **Legal compliance**: In many places, some laws and regulations require websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. Following accessibility guidelines can help you avoid legal issues.
- **Ethical considerations**: Everyone deserves equal access to information online. By creating an accessible website, you're ensuring everyone has a chance to experience your content.
